This repository contains a demonstration of a subtle off-by-one error in a COBOL program. The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, which involves a `PERFORM VARYING` loop that might not behave as expected under certain conditions, leading to potential issues.  The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version of the code, which addresses the identified error. This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop boundaries and index management in COBOL programming.
